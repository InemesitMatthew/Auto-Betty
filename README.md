# Betty Style Checker Script

## Overview

This project provides a Bash script that automates the process of checking and formatting your C code to comply with the Betty coding style guidelines. Betty is a popular coding style checker for C programming.

## Requirements

Before using this script, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

- [Betty Style Checker](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty): Ensure that you have Betty's style guidelines and checker installed on your system.

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script (e.g:`format_betty.sh`).

2. Make the script executable with the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x auto_betty.sh
   ```

3. Run the script with the name of the file you want to format as the argument:

   ```bash
   ./auto_betty.sh <filename>
   ```

   Replace `<filename>` with the name of your C file.

4. The script will run the Betty checker on the specified file. If Betty detects any style violations, it will provide feedback.

5. If Betty reports style issues, the script will automatically attempt to correct common issues, such as indentation and variable naming, based on your preferred coding style. You may need to modify the script to match your specific style.

6. After running the script, your code should be formatted to comply with Betty's style guidelines.

## Notes

- This script provides basic automatic fixes for common style issues. It may not address all issues, especially those related to function length. Manual code refactoring may be necessary for such cases.

- Always make sure to back up your code before running automated formatting scripts, as they can potentially introduce unintended changes.

- Review and customize the `sed` commands in the script to match your coding style and Betty's specific recommendations.
